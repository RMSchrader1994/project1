As someone once said:
>Blah blah blah blah blah
>>Someone, Sometime
>>>Cool!

I used semantic `<section>` tags instead of `<divs>`


```javascript
function multiplication(a,b) {
    if(typeof(a) == "number" && typeof(b) == "number") {
        return a * b;
    } else {
        return("Error!");
    }
}
