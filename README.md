# Gabriel Knight Website
 
## Overview
 
### What is this website for?
 
This is a fan site for those who have played the Gabriel Knight games and provides in depth details about each of the three games in the series. 
 
### What does it do?
 
This site has a separate page for each game that details the overall premise of the game, provides a full timeline of events for each game, and lists the name, voice actor/actor, and short description of the main characters of the games. The site also contains 3 short quizzes on each game that informs you of which quiz you complete and your final score.
 
### How does it work
 
This site uses simple HTML and CSS. The site is also styled with **Bootstrap**. The quiz has been created using **Javascript** to provide a total score and send an alert message when completed.
